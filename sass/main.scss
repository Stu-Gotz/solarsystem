/* Disclaimer: I wanted to make a solar system webpage because space is cool. I am
starting this while on what is effecitvely my fourth week of "finishing" a CSS
bootcamp and want to make stuff so why not. This is my starting point: 
http://www.independent-software.com/deconstructing-css-3-making-of-css3-solar-system-animation-3d-transformations.html

So basically, the universe through to mercury was completed, which I am using as a
kind of reference guide to fill out the rest. It uses these insanely long SVGs, so
I'm probably not gonna add those in because holy fuck. Anyway, I hope this goes well.
If you are looking at this, then odds are it probably has or is.

Also, I actually read the document after having sorted out the code sections, and
apparently this is just a guide of something someone else has done, so I'm really
reinventing the wheel here, but I guess walk then run. And I guess now I have a
reference for when I get stuck. This kind of turned into a Diarysclaimer. Sorry for that.*/
